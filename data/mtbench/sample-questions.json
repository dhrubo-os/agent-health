    ],
    "reference": "The average speed is 60 mph. Total distance is 300 miles (120 + 180), total time is 5 hours (2 + 3), so average speed = 300/5 = 60 mph."

    "reference": "A correct solution should: filter even numbers (n % 2 == 0), sum them, handle edge cases (empty list), and be efficient. Example: def sum_evens(nums): return sum(n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0)"
